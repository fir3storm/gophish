## Deploy These in 5 Minutes with HailBytes SAT

</p>

Running GoPhish yourself means managing infrastructure, maintaining sending profiles, exporting CSVs to track metrics, and stitching together your own reporting. **HailBytes SAT** gives you all of these templates pre-loaded in a fully managed security awareness training environment — deployed inside your own AWS or Azure account (BYOC) so your data never leaves your cloud.

HailBytes SAT is built for teams that need results without the ops overhead: a hardened enterprise platform, a live metrics dashboard, multi-tenant MSSP support, and compliance documentation (SOC 2 roadmap, NIST CSF mapping) included. Whether you run one campaign a quarter or manage phishing programs for dozens of clients, SAT scales without additional infrastructure work on your end.
